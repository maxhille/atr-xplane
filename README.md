ATR Open Source Project for X-Plane
===================================

This project intends to build a good set of ATR aircraft and share it with the community as open source.

## Goals
- short term: ATR 72-500 which is flyable and has the most basic features one would expect
- medium term: Aircraft is closer to study level by having realistic perfomance characteristics and systems
- long term: Have a complete set including ATR 42 and the -600 series

## Development set up
1. Clone this repo
2. link `ATR 72-500` into your X-Plane `Aircraft` folder
